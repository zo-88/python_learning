'''Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.'''


two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")

num1 = int(two_digit_number)
num2 = int(two_digit_number)

print(num1 + num2 )
